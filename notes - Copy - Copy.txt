why we use star schema?
--OLTP VS OLAP 
OLAP -- concurancy is low in it
OLTP -- high concurancy 

Snowflex Scheam -- is shape like snow flex 
star Scheema -- is hape like star shape

in OLTP we normilze basis on numeric and categorical both in difrent table.

##--------------------what is your data?

1) cloud - data is stores on cloud storage it uses Microsoft asure cloud.
2) on-premise - saving the data on local premises on data bases.
                it stores data on Micrsoft asure data base.

##--------------------how do you connect?

import data
direct Query
 
1) import data -1) geting data from data lake to power bi. in this we import all data in power bi 
                 it uses in-memory to import data -- all data is geting loaded in RAM. 
   problems -- 1) data retrival is slow, 
		   2) you can not have data with one GB or more if we want to handal we have to move to tablue 
		   3) it slow becous of latency and it depends on ether net spead 
2) direct query - it is directly connecting to sql server it will be slow becous we have to connect to it every time 
                  RAM will be free we can do diffrent task at same time this we can not do with import data.

##--------How to refresh data?

1) personal gateway ---> you are giveing the acces to data base to another person. it only for direct query. we are giving the acces of our sql server
	                becous the person has no acces to the sql server then we give gateway.
2) on-premises getway --> 
 

##-------Data on premises 

##-------component of power bi

1) power bi deckstop - downloding exe and using it
2) power bi servises - using it online on web 
3) power bi mobile   - power bi app on mobile

1) power bi deckstop - it is free open source ( diffrence is pbi and tablue - power bi is free, it dose not suport more then 1 gb data set, it dose not support real time conections)

diffrence in deckstop and power bi servises

data discovery - is same as EDA in ML 
360 viwe - we can connect all the data from  diffrent dep and we can get 360 viwe of tha data from all dep prespective.
 
we can get insides from any devise
we can do NLP on power bi
we can connet to any microsoft products

power bi servises---
report has all the information then user select imp info and those are called visualization.

commbinasion of pages is reaport.

we create -- columns in data view we can see the data

model view -- it is use to join the tables.
           -- every time you do not need to join the table.


Q) what are the diff types of filter in power bi 
report level
page level
tile level



to change the data befor importing 
1) insted of loading click on transform data.
2) we will get power query editor it help us to clean the table.
3) first remove top 3 rows
4) then remove last column
5) remove subtotal
6) select first column and last column to pevet the column - go in transfor and unpevet columns

When we cahnge the exle file we can get that canges in bi by just cleking refresh.

when we wan to split one colun into two column into diffrent columns

remember the data types in bi.




## decs -------

row level contex and 

calculated columns and measures 

salesmeasure= sales[sales amount]+sales[taxamt]


salesmeasure1=Sum(sales[sales amount],sales[taxamt])



sorting the columns ---

click on the column which we want to sort then click on sort by column
and select the column which columns sort we want to applay to the that column

-- create a measure 
-- new measure --> sum(sales[saleamount])-sum(sales[taxamount])

we can create measures on the tables which are not posible to join but to add the column of that calculation to the table becous we can not join these table.


--> to split the on ecolumn into the two columns

newcolumnname= Mid(table[column],Find("-",table[column],1,1)+1,Len(table[column]))



==== tablue =====

in tablue sheat is like a tile in pbi 
and collection of tiles is a dashbord and in bi we have page as dashboard.

dinamic demension on table/column in pbi-->

selector -- new column 
 
switch(first nonblank value(select[indicator],firstnonblankvalue(select[indicator],1))"positive",Relat)


for publish --

HOw to cheange only perticuler tile 
data interaction --

we can deside which tile will iteract with which tile

select tile -- format -- edit interactions

drildown filter -->
 if we have one filter and on that right click on one filter that will take us to next filter 

we can use coston visuals --> colour chart 

--> to change whole number into time

Column =
IF (
    LEN ( Table2[TR_TIME] ) = 4,
    LEFT ( Table2[TR_TIME], 2 ) & ":"
        & RIGHT ( Table2[TR_TIME], 2 ),
    LEFT ( Table2[TR_TIME], 1 ) & ":"
        & RIGHT ( Table2[TR_TIME], 2 )
)
